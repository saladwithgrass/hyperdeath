# Mechanics

Click to shoot, some weapons may have alt fires.

## Shadow Step --- To Do
WIP. Info will be later.

## Blindsight --- To Do
An ability that is put on **the focus** meter. When activated, you close your eyes and perceive surroundings based on hearing/cybernetics or some shit.

# Enemies

## Basic Enemy
Just a regular guy with a pistol.

## Machine Gun Enemy
A slow guy that shoots in bursts, then has to reload for some time.

## Melee Enemy
A very fast guy that tries to melee the player.

## Teleporting Enemy
A guy that teleports behind player and tries to melee.

# Design
## Main Menu
I could make the main menu look like a terminal. When player boots the game, it prints the help list to console and the player has to type in commands to select proper options. Would be cool.

# Crazy Ideas for the future
## Melee Kick
When doing a melee, check if there are any projectiles coming, if there are none, perform a kick, otherwise, parry.
