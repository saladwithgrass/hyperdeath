# TODOs
## Refactor the UI
Ideally the player should be kind of like an NPC, with interface being around
him.
## Rebalance LMG
Right now it's too powerful, i don't like it.

# Mechanics
## Walk --- Done
Just WASD to walk with a constant speed.
## Dash --- Done
Shift to dash in the direction of current motion or in direction of the mouse
cursor.
## Shoot --- Done
Click to shoot, some weapons may have alt fires.
## Melee --- Buggy
F to melee, can parry projectiles and melee atacks.
## Shadow Step --- To Do
WIP. Info will be later.
## Blindsight --- To Do
An ability that is put on **the focus** meter. When activated, you close your
eyes and perceive surroundings based on hearing/cybernetics or some shit.

# Weapons
I should create a weapon system that stores parameters as a config file.
This file contains the following fields:
* Path to projectile scene
* Path to weapon model
* Projectile damage
* Fire rate
* Is it automatic
* Does it have alt fire 
* Weapon type: Shotgun/Single Projectile/Hitscan

## Pistol
## LMG
## Railgun
## Shotgun

# Enemies
## Basic Enemy
Just a regular guy with a pistol.
## Machine Gun Enemy
A slow guy that shoots in bursts, then has to reload for some time.
## Melee Enemy
A very fast guy that tries to melee the player.
## Teleporting Enemy
A guy that teleports behind player and tries to melee.

# Design
## Main Menu
I could make the main menu look like a terminal. When player boots the game, it
prints the help list to console and the player has to type in commands to
select proper options. Would be cool.
# Known Bugs
## Player enemy spawn
When pressing all three spawn keys, one enemy spawns in the air and cannot go down.
# Crazy Ideas for the future
## Melee Kick
When doing a melee, check if there are any projectiles coming, if there are none, perform a kick, otherwise, parry.
## ENLIGHTENMENT IS A DRUG
### NOOSPHERE IS REAL
Due to a huge amount of information floating around in the net field, which can
actually be called Noosphere., some people can start receiving overwhelming
amounts of ideas and concepts. The longer a person draws information from the
the more addicted he becomes. However when a person gets cut off from this
field, they get a very tough withdrawal syndrome.
