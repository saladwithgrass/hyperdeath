# Fuck, i do not know how to title this game for now. Maybe some name will come.

A top-down shooter game about a shadow witch trying to escape a medieval salem-like city/village.

# Mechanics
I want this game to be a fast paced and mechanically complex game like ULTRAKILL with a tiny bit of RUINER. 

## Walking
Just movement. You press a button and walk.

## Dashing
You can perform a very short dash in the direction you're moving.
Or in the direction of the cursor, if you are not moving.
When dashing, you are invincible.

## Shadow Step
Light sources cast shadows.
Basic state of a spot on the floor is zero when it is not illuminated and not shadowed.
When spot is illuminated(e.g. with a torch), it's lightness goes up.
Any shadow can be used for you to appear in.
For example, if some witch hunters are coming toward you with a torch, you could shadow step behind them with this ability.
This is the `Killer Feature` of this game. Light will be dynamic and you can use any big enough shadow to teleport.
To use this ability, you need to have some "shadow freshness" or smth.

## Shooting
You launch some rays or projectiles in the direction of the cursor. That is it.
I'd like to add different kinds of weapons. 
Casting a spell slows you down or makes you immobile.
Crossbow does not slow you down, but needs to be reloaded.
### Ranged weapons ideas
1) Crossbow. Projectile weapon that can be turned into a "shotgun" or an "SMG". Kind of. Given from the start.
2) Hive spell. Summons a swarm of wasps that try to stay around the cursor and damage anyone close to it.
3) Lightning bolt. Of course. Hitscan weapon.
4) Fire stream. Basically a flamethrower-like weapon. Short range, good damage.
5) Knife telekinesis. Shotgun-like spell that launches multiple knives in some direction a-la Dio from Jojo.
6) 

## Melee
Perform a strike with a dagger that deals a moderate amount of damage.
Maybe i should add different kinds of daggers that do positional damage(backstab, attack from the side)
Melee attacks can be parried which does not deal damage, but stuns your enemy(maybe i'll change it who knows).
### Dagger ideas
1) Backstabber -- Mediocre damage up front, big damage from backstabs.
2) Jumper -- IDK about this one at all. Can be thrown. Can be teleported to. You get the idea.
3) Bloodletter -- Performs a bloodletting on enemies. Maybe boosts your speed based on how much blood you let run. IDK.

## Utility Spells
Some spells that cannot be shot or used as a weapon, but still may be cool.
1) Darkness. Makes all floor be shadow.
2) Shield. You know.
3) Light Orb. Cast a small but bright orb of light that stays in a specified position. Maybe i'll make it able to move or smth.
4) 

# Enemies

### Guards
Slow, very little hp, but aboove average damage. Tutorial enemies. Like filth from ULTRAKILL.

### Knight
A "holy" knight with a sword.
Has a lot of HP and does decent damage. Somewhat slow.

### Melee witch hunter
Typically hunts in packs with other witch hunters
A dude in leather armor with a club.
Runs kinda fast, low-medium hp. Below average damage.
The default enemy.
When he gets close can drain your "shadow freshness" or mana for spells by reciting a prayer.

### Crossbow witch hunter
Hangs back and shoots you with a crossbow.
Small damage, low hp, almost static.

### Priest
Very mobile, tries to keep to the back rows or runs away while throwing minor spells.
Recites prayers that act as spells. 
Comes only with some kind of security for himself.
Does major damage, has low hp.

### Holy Father/Mother
VERY mobile. Can teleport.
Casts powerfull spells with loads of damage. Acts a lot like a mini-boss.

### Blessed swordsman
A tall guy with little to no armor. Wields a huge greatsword.
Has low-mid hp, does huge damage.
Can teleport to any illuminated spot on the floor.
Has the following pattern:
1) Teleport to a spot 
2) Attack
3) Retreat
4) Repeat

# Worldbuilding and lore.
Events of the game occur in a medium/small medieval city called Lumnitz.
You play as a shadow witch. I'll call her Marpa(idk).
Shadow witches are not too frequent, but are considered to be dangerous.
There's a witch hunting authority that has different branches dedicated to hunting different kinds of witches.
This authority is structured kind of like a religion, but also a governing body.
It spooks regular people and has its own kind of army. To hunt witches.
Also it pays in gold for every witch brought to "justice".
Not every small city has specially trained people, but they can be sent to a city/village if any rumors of witches arise there.

## Witches
Any witch or wizard has their powers from studies. 
Typically, any witch-person is predisposed to a certain kind of magic, but can use any spell, only level of effort differs.
### Magic Chapters
#### 1) Chapter of Chemios. Non-living Magic(Fire, Lightning, etc.). 
Most popular chapter of magic, any magic person can use it. Typically the first spells learned are from this chapter.
#### 2) Chapter of Bios. Livinig Magic(Summon/control creatures, e.g. Hive Spell)
Very popular among village healers and people of this kind.
Has niche uses.
#### 3) Chapter of Hemos. Blood Magic(Basically vampires)
People who use this kind of magic begin to transform over time.
They start developing immunities for many sicknesses that spread through blood.
At the same time blood users, begin to need blood for survival.
#### 4) Chapter of Umbra. Shadow magic(Marpa)
These people are rare and with time they begin to develop weakness to light.
At the later stages, shadow mages stop being able to cast in the light.
#### There probably will be more.

## Tutorial intro
Marpa wakes up in a prison cell. 
Some guards discuss how she is accused of witchcraft, but not the shadow kind, and that the `. Like she fried some asshole's balls or something.
Sooner or later the guards move to another room.
There's a cell right across. There sits a young man with dirty long hair and whispers to Marpa to come to him.
From the nearby room, a guards screams for prisoners to be silent.
He stands before the torch in his cell which forms a shadow.
Tutorial pops up that tells the player how to do shadow step.
You get to the other cell. The man gives Marpa a primitive shank and screams for guards.
When guards come in, shadows form behind them, which player can use to shadow step and melee the guards.
Marpa picks up the keys from the guards and opens the man's cell.
