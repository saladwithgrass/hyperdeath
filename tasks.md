# ~~Camera Fixes~~
### Movement 
Fix camera movement, make it smoother:
- On dash make camera lag a bit behind.
- Also make it drag after starting movement.

### ~~Visibility~~
Make lower part of the screen visible 
# Tooling
I'd like to make creating levels easier.
I ~~do not~~ know how yet, but tasks will arrve.
## Level objects.
I find it to be quite cumbersome to have a tonne of walls in the main level scene, i think i will have to cook something up to make managing leve geometry easier.
